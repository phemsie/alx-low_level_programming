Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. where index is the index, starting from 0.
Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. Not allowed to use the % or / operators.
